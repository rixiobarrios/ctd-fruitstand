            'Quantity/Pack: 6 - 7 count\nSeasonality: Year Round\nOrigin: South Africa\n\nSouth Africa is noted for these baby pineapples, also known as Queen Victoria Pineapples, which thrive in the hot and humid climate.\n\nThese sweet, tart baby pineapples have a bold, rich flavor. They have a fragrant, golden skin and brilliantly colored yellow flesh. South African baby pineapples are entirely edible, with no need to remove the core. The size of an average fruit is about 4.5 inches high (not including leaves) and about 3.5 inches in diameter, making it a perfect individual serving.\n\nPacked in a reusable wood crate, our South African Baby Pineapples serve as a wonderfully exotic gift.\n\nLook for fruit with bright coloring and deep green leaves. Avoid pineapples with brown or soft spots and dry brown leaves. Keep in refrigeration for up to ten days.\n\nRemove crown and a small portion of the base, or simply cut in half, leaving crown on, for a beautiful, succulent plate garnish.\n\nNo need to cut out the core of the pineapple, it is entirely edible and not tough at all. These pineapples are low in acid and delicious when eaten fresh out of hand or added to fruit salads.\n\nHawaii prohibits the shipment of any pineapple into their state.\n\nThis item is perishable and must ship at least 2nd day. \nAny orders that do not have the appropriate shipping method selected will not be shipped.

            'Net weight of edible food 8.5 lbs.\nGiving your loved one a beautifully wrapped basketful of Melissa’s premium Asian Pears combined with decadent Chocolate Toffee Almonds and Chocolate Bridge Mix, and finally a bottle of sparkling Blanc de Blance, you will surely win their heart.\n\nSchramsberg Blanc de Blanc was the first wine Schramsberg produced in 1965 and was America’s first commercially produced Chardonnay-based brut sparkling wine. It gained international recognition in 1972 when then President Nixon served the wine at the historic “Toast to Peace” in Beijing, China.\n\nThe Schramsberg style of Blanc de Blancs is dry and crisp. Small lots of malolactic- and barrel-fermented wines are added for complexity.  This sparkling wine will maintain its freshness, structure and refined finish for many years, even decades following its initial release. While this wine can be enjoyed by itself as an apéritif, it is also perfect with fresh oysters and other shellfish, crab cakes, ceviche and grilled sea bass. It is also delicious with lemon chicken and Thai curries. Serve with aged Gouda or other hard cheeses, and as a counterpoint to soft triple creams.\n\nComposition: 100% Chardonnay from mostly Napa and Sonoma Counties\nAlcohol: 12.8%\n\nTasting notes:\n“The 2018 Blanc de Blancs has bright aromas of fresh apples, lemon-lime and warm wheat toast, intermingled with hints of baked pineapple and toasted almonds.  It\'s vibrant flavors of Meyer lemon and Granny Smith apples bring a nice tartness to the mid-palate, leading to a clean, bright finish".  -Winemakers Sean Thompson and Hugh Davis\nSending Wine as a Gift: You may purchase wine as a gift as long as you and the intended recipient are both 21 years of age or older.

Known as the inside-out orange, kumquats are sweet on the outside and tart on the inside.\nDespite its small demeanor, kumquats are filled with a burst of sweet-tart citrus flavor. The paper-thin skin is where the majority of the sugar lies and has virtually no bitter pith; however, the flesh is mouth-puckeringly sour.\nTo no surprise, kumquats are filled with an abundant supply of vitamin C and fiber and have more fiber in a serving (about five whole Kumquats) than most other fresh fruits. Because the entire fruit is edible, it can be candied or eaten whole. If candied, kumquats are perfect in fruitcakes and holiday truffles.\nAlso use in dressings, frostings or preserves, or mix into stuffing, cakes and muffins.\n\nLook for fruit that is shiny with good color. Avoid those with blemishes or soft spots.

It gets its name from the Malaysian word for hair, "rambut." It has a juicy-sweet texture, and an enjoyable flavor similar to a lychee, but less acidic. Peel off the hairy skin to extract the fruit, and remove the seed. The rosy flavor of the rambutan resembles a combination of a strawberry and a muscat grape. Its fragrant perfume characterizes this unique fruit. The rambutan can be eaten by itself or in salads, with vegetables, and in sauces.\n\nPick rambutans that are brownish in color. To avoid moisture loss, store rambutans wrapped in a paper towel and in a perforated plastic bag. Produces very low ethylene. Keep humidity level high and a temperature of 34 - 40°F.\n\nThey should not be peeled until just before they are served. Remove peel and black seed.

Cherimoyas outer shell looks similar to a lizard-green pinecone with leathery scales. While the surface looks almost like armor, it is highly suggested to treat with care due to easy bruising. As the fruit begins to ripen, the skin will start to turn a darker green-brown or grayish color and will yield to gentle pressure. Another indication of ripeness is when the stem can be easily removed from the fruit.\n\nWhen opening up a Cherimoya, you will be immersed in the sweet floral scent of vanilla and banana. The custard white flesh has a blend of flavors with hints of pineapple, papaya, vanilla, pear, strawberry and even mango. Be sure to remove the inedible black seeds before consuming.\n\nCherimoya is best eaten raw and chilled, eaten as-is or in compotes, ice creams, drinks and sorbets. Due to Cherimoya's flavor, they pair nicely with similar tropical flavors like papaya (strawberry and red), mangoes (all varieties), mangosteen, dragon fruit, pineapples, jackfruit, mamey spate, lychees, guavas and feijoas.\n\nRefrigerate softened fruit and eat as soon as possible for best flavor.

It gets its name from the Malaysian word for hair, "rambut." It has a juicy-sweet texture, and an enjoyable flavor similar to a lychee, but less acidic. Peel off the hairy skin to extract the fruit, and remove the seed. The rosy flavor of the rambutan resembles a combination of a strawberry and a muscat grape. Its fragrant perfume characterizes this unique fruit. The rambutan can be eaten by itself or in salads, with vegetables, and in sauces.\n\nPick rambutans that are brownish in color. To avoid moisture loss, store rambutans wrapped in a paper towel and in a perforated plastic bag. Produces very low ethylene. Keep humidity level high and a temperature of 34 - 40°F.\n\nThey should not be peeled until just before they are served. Remove peel and black seed. Sometimes the seed is used in cooking, such as tea.

            'Quantity/Pack: 3 bottles (17 Ounces each)\nSeasonality: Year Round\nOrigin: Mexico\nAs a hot sauce that’s full flavor with a healthy amount of tang, we suggest you try it on nearly everything and use liberally.\n\nIf you’re looking for a condiment with just the right spice, Melissa’s Costa Azul Hot Sauce is just what your food needs and your taste buds crave. The flavor profile is rich and smoky, with slightly sweet undertones. As a hot sauce that’s full flavor with a healthy amount of tang, we suggest you try it on nearly everything and use liberally.\n\nThis hot sauce is made from the red jalapeño grown at the southern tip of Mexico’s Baja Peninsula, where the growing conditions and rich soil produce a uniquely flavorful pepper. The red jalapeño pepper is simply a green jalapeño that has been left on the vine to mature. During that ripening process, the jalapeño changes color from green to red. The additional ripening means more capsaicin has had time to develop in the pepper; which is what gives hot peppers their spiciness. The green jalapeño has a fresh, crisp taste, while a red jalapeño is sweeter with slightly more heat.\n\nPackaged exclusively for Melissa’s, we named this tasty sauce after a well-known beach in the region, Costa Azul. Melissa’s Costa Azul Hot Sauce is shelf-stable and should be stored in a cool, dry place. After opening, refrigerate and use within 30 days.\n\n',

Organic Yellow Onions are preferred for reasons of taste, health and the environment.

When selecting yellow onions avoid any signs of moisture, green shoots or dark spots. Keep in mind that humidity breeds spoilage in dry onions.\n\nStore whole onions in a cool, dry place with good air circulation for up to two months (depending on condition when purchased).\n\nOnce cut, tightly wrap any unused onion in plastic, refrigerate and use within four days.\n",

It is very popular in Creole dishes and is the base ingredient in gumbo.\nOkra, also known as ladies\' fingers or ochro, is a unique and widely polarizing vegetable. The flavor is a pleasant blend of eggplant and green bean. Snappy green edible pods surround rows of edible white seeds that pop pleasantly in the mouth. The seeds are surrounded by a slightly "gooey" substance that exudes when bitten or cut. One of the unique traits of okra is its ability to thicken gumbos, which many love.\n\nYou can sauté, deep-fry or simmer okra in a stew as a thickening agent. Raw okra can be pickled. Often used as a replacement for zucchini in many recipes; stuff with vegetable or meat filling and bake. Avoid cooking okra in pans made of iron, copper or brass, as their reactive properties turn the vegetable black.\n\nLook for small pods, about two to three inches long; they will be more tender and flavorful than larger pods. Avoid okra that looks dry or dull. Refrigerate unwashed and untrimmed in a paper bag in the crisper drawer for three to five days.\n\nThis item is perishable and must ship Overnight.\n',
