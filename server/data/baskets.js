      'Quantity/Pack: 6 - 7 count\nSeasonality: Year Round\nOrigin: South Africa\n\nSouth Africa is noted for these baby pineapples, also known as Queen Victoria Pineapples, which thrive in the hot and humid climate.\n\nThese sweet, tart baby pineapples have a bold, rich flavor. They have a fragrant, golden skin and brilliantly colored yellow flesh. South African baby pineapples are entirely edible, with no need to remove the core. The size of an average fruit is about 4.5 inches high (not including leaves) and about 3.5 inches in diameter, making it a perfect individual serving.\n\nPacked in a reusable wood crate, our South African Baby Pineapples serve as a wonderfully exotic gift.\n\nLook for fruit with bright coloring and deep green leaves. Avoid pineapples with brown or soft spots and dry brown leaves. Keep in refrigeration for up to ten days.\n\nRemove crown and a small portion of the base, or simply cut in half, leaving crown on, for a beautiful, succulent plate garnish.\n\nNo need to cut out the core of the pineapple, it is entirely edible and not tough at all. These pineapples are low in acid and delicious when eaten fresh out of hand or added to fruit salads.\n\nHawaii prohibits the shipment of any pineapple into their state.\n\nThis item is perishable and must ship at least 2nd day. \nAny orders that do not have the appropriate shipping method selected will not be shipped.

      'Net weight of edible food 8.5 lbs.\nGiving your loved one a beautifully wrapped basketful of Melissa’s premium Asian Pears combined with decadent Chocolate Toffee Almonds and Chocolate Bridge Mix, and finally a bottle of sparkling Blanc de Blance, you will surely win their heart.\n\nSchramsberg Blanc de Blanc was the first wine Schramsberg produced in 1965 and was America’s first commercially produced Chardonnay-based brut sparkling wine. It gained international recognition in 1972 when then President Nixon served the wine at the historic “Toast to Peace” in Beijing, China.\n\nThe Schramsberg style of Blanc de Blancs is dry and crisp. Small lots of malolactic- and barrel-fermented wines are added for complexity.  This sparkling wine will maintain its freshness, structure and refined finish for many years, even decades following its initial release. While this wine can be enjoyed by itself as an apéritif, it is also perfect with fresh oysters and other shellfish, crab cakes, ceviche and grilled sea bass. It is also delicious with lemon chicken and Thai curries. Serve with aged Gouda or other hard cheeses, and as a counterpoint to soft triple creams.\n\nComposition: 100% Chardonnay from mostly Napa and Sonoma Counties\nAlcohol: 12.8%\n\nTasting notes:\n“The 2018 Blanc de Blancs has bright aromas of fresh apples, lemon-lime and warm wheat toast, intermingled with hints of baked pineapple and toasted almonds.  It\'s vibrant flavors of Meyer lemon and Granny Smith apples bring a nice tartness to the mid-palate, leading to a clean, bright finish".  -Winemakers Sean Thompson and Hugh Davis\nSending Wine as a Gift: You may purchase wine as a gift as long as you and the intended recipient are both 21 years of age or older.
