The thin skin, unless waxed, does not require peeling. Pickling cucumbers, specifically, are dense, small and crunchy with little bumps, making them the perfect size for a pickling jar.\n\nPickling cucumbers, when not used as pickles, are excellent sliced and diced and used in salads, cut into spears and served with a dip, or slice lengthwise and use in sandwiches in place of lettuce.\n\nAvoid yellow ones and those that have dried ends, which is a sign of bitterness and toughness. Before pickling, place whole in a plastic bag and refrigerate up to 10 days or cut up and wrap tightly in plastic for up to five days.\nThis item is perishable and must ship at least 2nd day.\n\nAny orders that do not have the appropriate shipping method selected will not be shipped out.

      'Quantity/Pack: 1 Pound\nSeasonality: Apr - June, Aug - Sep\nOrigin: USA\nThis item must be shipped alone and sent Overnight due to perishability.\nSweet yet mild, mellow yet rich…Black Mission Figs deserve their reputation as the most consistently delicious fresh fig available. While they have a flavor all their own, the taste could be described as a mix of strawberry, melon and banana flavors, with a pleasantly jammy, creamy texture.\n\nFigs can be enjoyed just as they are, or prepared and cooked. They make an excellent addition to cheese platters and a welcome addition to salads with spicy greens. They are wonderful for homemade jams and preserves as well as cakes and muffins. Stuff figs with cheese or ham, or slice and include in grilled cheese sandwiches. Dip in chocolate for a luscious treat.\n\nSelect Black Mission Figs that smell fresh and are fairly soft. Ripen at room temperature or spread in a single layer on paper towels, cover with plastic and refrigerate for a few days. Figs may also be sealed in a plastic bag and frozen for up to six months. \n\nAny orders that do not have the appropriate shipping method selected will not be shipped out.

      'Quantity/Pack: 2 Pounds\nSeasonality: Year Round\nOrigin: USA, Mexico\nIts versatility allows for okra to be added to many different recipes. It is very popular in Creole dishes and is the base ingredient in gumbo.\nOkra, also known as ladies\' fingers or ochro, is a unique and widely polarizing vegetable. The flavor is a pleasant blend of eggplant and green bean. Snappy green edible pods surround rows of edible white seeds that pop pleasantly in the mouth. The seeds are surrounded by a slightly "gooey" substance that exudes when bitten or cut. One of the unique traits of okra is its ability to thicken gumbos, which many love.\n\nYou can sauté, deep-fry or simmer okra in a stew as a thickening agent. Raw okra can be pickled. Often used as a replacement for zucchini in many recipes; stuff with vegetable or meat filling and bake. Avoid cooking okra in pans made of iron, copper or brass, as their reactive properties turn the vegetable black.\n\nLook for small pods, about two to three inches long; they will be more tender and flavorful than larger pods. Avoid okra that looks dry or dull. Refrigerate unwashed and untrimmed in a paper bag in the crisper drawer for three to five days.\n\nThis item is perishable and must ship Overnight.\n',
