Peel off the hairy skin to extract the fruit, and remove the seed. The rosy flavor of the rambutan resembles a combination of a strawberry and a muscat grape. Its fragrant perfume characterizes this unique fruit. The rambutan can be eaten by itself or in salads, with vegetables, and in sauces.\n\nPick rambutans that are brownish in color. To avoid moisture loss, store rambutans wrapped in a paper towel and in a perforated plastic bag. Produces very low ethylene. Keep humidity level high and a temperature of 34 - 40°F.\n\nThey should not be peeled until just before they are served. Remove peel and black seed. Sometimes the seed is used in cooking, such as tea.

      "Quantity/Pack: 3 Pounds\nSeasonality: Year Round (California: Nov-Apr, Chile: May-Nov)\nOrigin: USA, Chile\nThe unique flavor and creamy texture of the Cherimoya will deliciously transport your taste buds to an exotic destination with the very first bite.\n\nCherimoya, also known as the custard apple, is a sub-tropical fruit. Cherimoyas outer shell looks similar to a lizard-green pinecone with leathery scales. While the surface looks almost like armor, it is highly suggested to treat with care due to easy bruising. As the fruit begins to ripen, the skin will start to turn a darker green-brown or grayish color and will yield to gentle pressure. Another indication of ripeness is when the stem can be easily removed from the fruit.\n\nWhen opening up a Cherimoya, you will be immersed in the sweet floral scent of vanilla and banana. The custard white flesh has a blend of flavors with hints of pineapple, papaya, vanilla, pear, strawberry and even mango. Be sure to remove the inedible black seeds before consuming.\n\nCherimoya is best eaten raw and chilled, eaten as-is or in compotes, ice creams, drinks and sorbets. Due to Cherimoya's flavor, they pair nicely with similar tropical flavors like papaya (strawberry and red), mangoes (all varieties), mangosteen, dragon fruit, pineapples, jackfruit, mamey spate, lychees, guavas and feijoas.\n\nRefrigerate softened fruit and eat as soon as possible for best flavor. Keep in mind that once you cut the gruit, the flesh discolors quickly.\n\nThis item is perishable and must ship at least 2nd Day.\n\nAny orders that do not have the appropriate shipping method selected will not be shipped out.

      "Quantity/Pack: 3 count\nSeasonality: Year Round\nOrigin: USA, Vietnam\n\nThe Dragon Fruit is an exotic cactus fruit that has a delicately sweet and mildly acidic flavor, reminiscent of watermelon, cactus pear, and kiwi. All Melissa's Dragon Fruit plants flower at night and emit a jasmine-like fragrance. The fruit itself is round and its exterior ranges in color from a hot pink to red. The interior color of dragon fruit ranges from white to red. All both types have tiny, edible black seeds (very similar to those found inside Kiwi). This fruit does not grow well in winter cold or summer heat, so its availability is limited, making it a highly prized treat. The melon-like texture of the Dragon Fruit makes it ideal for blending into drinks as well as using in sorbets.\n\nMelissa's Dragon Fruit are hand-selected for excellent quality. Melissa's Dragon Fruit should be kept refrigerated, unwashed, for up to 5 days. Best served chilled.\n\nImported Dragon Fruit (white flesh) is available year round.\n\nDomestic Dragon Fruit (white flesh and red flesh) is only available Aug-Dec typically.\n\nThis item is perishable and must ship at least 2nd day.\n\nAny orders that do not have the appropriate shipping method selected will not be shipped out.

      'Quantity/Pack: 6 - 7 count\nSeasonality: Year Round\nOrigin: South Africa\n\nSouth Africa is noted for these baby pineapples, also known as Queen Victoria Pineapples, which thrive in the hot and humid climate.\n\nThese sweet, tart baby pineapples have a bold, rich flavor. They have a fragrant, golden skin and brilliantly colored yellow flesh. South African baby pineapples are entirely edible, with no need to remove the core.
