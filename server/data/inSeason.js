      'Quantity/Pack: 6 packages or 18 packages (1.7 Ounces each)\nSeasonality: Year Round\nOrigin: France\n\n\nHollandaise means Holland-style or from Holland, though this buttery-smooth sauce can be traced to a 17th Century French cookbook. The two main ingredients in this iconic sauce are eggs and butter. However, during World War I, France’s butter production was interrupted, so butter had to be imported from Holland. The name was changed to hollandaise to indicate the source of the butter and was never changed back. Making this emulsified sauce has always required a good deal of culinary experience. \n\nMelissa’s pre-made Hollandaise is perfect for the novice chef. It contains only natural ingredients, tastes as good as homemade and comes in a convenient one-serving packet. Serve hot on vegetables, especially asparagus; it is also delicious on fish or eggs, like eggs Benedict. \n\n',

      'Quantity/Pack: 3 packages (2 count each)\nSeasonality: Year Round\nOrigin: USA, Mexico\nGarlic is great for improving your health and our organic growers use traditional earth-friendly farming methods. Melissa’s Organic Garlic is an excellent choice when you want to add a distinct seasoning to your dish. Expect the flavors to mellow and sweeten considerably with cooking.\n\nMelissa’s Organic Garlic is excellent when used in many Italian and Old World recipes, including pizza and pasta. However, Garlic is a favorite of practically all cultures, from Italian, French, Russian, Asian, Indian, Greek, and Hispanic recipes.\nLook for Organic Garlic that is firm, heavy for size and has tight unbroken skins. Keep in mind that humidity breeds spoilage in garlic. Store garlic bulbs in a cool, dry place with good air circulation for up to two months (depending on condition when purchased). Once cut, tightly wrap any unused garlic in plastic, refrigerate and use within four days. Once peeled, garlic may also be frozen in a tightly sealed container until ready to use.',

      'Quantity/Pack: 3 bottles (17 Ounces each)\nSeasonality: Year Round\nOrigin: Mexico\nAs a hot sauce that’s full flavor with a healthy amount of tang, we suggest you try it on nearly everything and use liberally.\n\nIf you’re looking for a condiment with just the right spice, Melissa’s Costa Azul Hot Sauce is just what your food needs and your taste buds crave. The flavor profile is rich and smoky, with slightly sweet undertones. As a hot sauce that’s full flavor with a healthy amount of tang, we suggest you try it on nearly everything and use liberally.\n\nThis hot sauce is made from the red jalapeño grown at the southern tip of Mexico’s Baja Peninsula, where the growing conditions and rich soil produce a uniquely flavorful pepper. The red jalapeño pepper is simply a green jalapeño that has been left on the vine to mature. During that ripening process, the jalapeño changes color from green to red. The additional ripening means more capsaicin has had time to develop in the pepper; which is what gives hot peppers their spiciness. The green jalapeño has a fresh, crisp taste, while a red jalapeño is sweeter with slightly more heat.\n\nPackaged exclusively for Melissa’s, we named this tasty sauce after a well-known beach in the region, Costa Azul. Melissa’s Costa Azul Hot Sauce is shelf-stable and should be stored in a cool, dry place. After opening, refrigerate and use within 30 days.\n\n',
